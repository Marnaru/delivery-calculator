# Delivery Calculator - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Delivery Calculator project. Tasks are organized logically, starting with architectural improvements followed by code-level enhancements.

## Architectural Improvements

### Build System & Project Structure
1. [x] Migrate from plain Java project to Maven or Gradle build system
2. [x] Create proper directory structure following Maven conventions (src/main/java, src/test/java)
3. [x] Add build configuration file (pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle)
4. [x] Configure proper dependency management for testing frameworks and logging

### Configuration Management
5. [ ] Create a configuration file (properties or YAML) for delivery prices
6. [ ] Implement configuration loader class to read delivery prices from external file
7. [ ] Add support for different environments (dev, test, prod) configurations
8. [x] Create constants class for system-wide configuration values

### Testing Infrastructure
9. [x] Set up proper testing framework (JUnit 5 or TestNG)
10. [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for all strategy implementations
11. [x] Add integration tests for the Order class and strategy interactions
12. [ ] Implement test coverage reporting and ensure minimum 80% coverage
13. [ ] Add parameterized tests for different delivery scenarios

### Logging & Monitoring
14. [ ] Replace System.out.println with proper logging framework (SLF4J + Logback)
15. [ ] Add appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) throughout the application
16. [ ] Create logging configuration file with different appenders
17. [ ] Add performance monitoring for delivery price calculations

### Documentation
18. [ ] Create comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions
19. [x] Add JavaDoc comments to all public classes and methods
20. [ ] Create API documentation for the strategy interface
21. [ ] Document design patterns and architectural decisions
22. [ ] Add code examples and usage scenarios in documentation

## Code Quality Improvements

### Encapsulation & Access Control
23. [x] Make deliveryPrice field private in Order class and add getter if needed
24. [ ] Review and adjust access modifiers for all class members
25. [ ] Ensure proper encapsulation principles are followed throughout

### Input Validation & Error Handling
26. [x] Add null validation for DeliveryPrice parameter in Order constructor
27. [x] Add validation for negative product prices in calculateTotal method
28. [ ] Implement proper exception handling with custom exceptions
29. [ ] Add input sanitization and boundary checks
30. [ ] Create validation utility class for common validation operations

### Code Organization & Structure
31. [x] Fix package naming convention (change StrategyOfSystem to strategyofsystem or delivery.strategy)
32. [ ] Remove unnecessary blank lines and improve code formatting consistency
33. [x] Add proper class-level and method-level comments
34. [ ] Organize imports and remove unused imports
35. [ ] Ensure consistent indentation and code style throughout

### Constants & Magic Numbers
36. [x] Extract hardcoded delivery prices to named constants
37. [x] Create DeliveryPrices enum or constants class
38. [x] Replace magic numbers with meaningful constant names
39. [x] Add currency unit documentation for price values

### Method & Class Design
40. [ ] Consider adding toString() methods to all classes for better debugging
41. [ ] Implement equals() and hashCode() methods where appropriate
42. [ ] Add builder pattern for Order class if it grows more complex
43. [ ] Consider adding factory method for creating delivery strategies

### Performance & Optimization
44. [ ] Analyze and optimize object creation in main method
45. [ ] Consider caching strategy instances if they're stateless
46. [ ] Add performance benchmarks for delivery calculations
47. [ ] Review memory usage and optimize if necessary

## Feature Enhancements

### Extensibility
48. [ ] Add support for dynamic delivery pricing based on distance/weight
49. [ ] Implement delivery time estimation feature
50. [ ] Add support for multiple currencies and currency conversion
51. [ ] Create plugin architecture for adding new delivery strategies

### User Interface
52. [ ] Create command-line interface for interactive usage
53. [ ] Add input validation and user-friendly error messages
54. [ ] Implement help system and usage instructions
55. [ ] Add option to save and load order configurations

### Data Persistence
56. [ ] Add support for saving orders to file or database
57. [ ] Implement order history and tracking functionality
58. [ ] Add data export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
59. [ ] Create data backup and recovery mechanisms

## Quality Assurance

### Code Analysis
60. [ ] Set up static code analysis tools (SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle)
61. [ ] Configure code quality gates and minimum quality thresholds
62. [ ] Add code review checklist and guidelines
63. [ ] Implement automated code formatting (Google Java Format or similar)

### Continuous Integration
64. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar)
65. [ ] Add automated testing on multiple Java versions
66. [ ] Configure automated code quality checks
67. [ ] Add automated deployment and release processes

### Security
68. [ ] Review code for potential security vulnerabilities
69. [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
